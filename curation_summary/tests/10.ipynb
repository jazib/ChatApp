        "1. You only hire candidates who have work experience directly related to software application development. Specifically, you want candidates who could work in the following areas: [Frontend, Backend, Full Stack, DevOps, QA, Mobile, Data Science, Data Engineering, Data Analyst, or Engineering Lead]. If their most recent work history falls outside software development, reject them with the code \"NOT_CORE_ROLE\".\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Infer which country the candidate comes from. In order to proceed in hiring, the candidate must come from one of the following approved countries [Canada, Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Costa Rica, Poland, Spain, Romania, Hungary]. You reject candidates from any other country. If the candidate is not from the right country, use the rejection code \"OUTSIDE_GEO\".\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Infer the total years of experience the candidate has as a software developer. Calculate this by surveying all the items in their candidate_work_experiences and using just the jobs related to software engineering. Use the job's start_date in YYYY-MM-DD format to understand when they began each job. Many end_dates are missing, especially for current jobs, so be aware today's data is July 31, 2023. In order to proceed in hiring, the candidate must have 2 or more years of total hands-on software development experience. If the candidate does not have at least 2 years of experience, use the rejection code \"TOO_JUNIOR\".\n",

        "4. Infer whether the candidate has Tech/Team Lead experience. You prefer candidates with tech or team lead experience over those without, but this is not a requirement just a nice-to-have.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Infer whether the candidate is an individual contributor or a manager. If the candidate is a senior manager and has been focused on management or executive roles for more than 3 years, use the rejection code \"NOT_IC\".\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Infer the candidate's technology skills from both their set of skills and their job titles. In order for the candidate to proceed, they should work with modern tools and frameworks. If the candidate only works with old tools like C and Java, we are not interested in them and they should be rejected with the code \"NOT_CORE_FOCUS\".\n",
